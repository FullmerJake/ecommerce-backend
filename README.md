  ## Installation
  All you have to do is download the files from this repository. Open them in your prefered text editor and code away. Package.json has a few node scripts you can use to seed and start the program, and the dependancies you will need to make sure to download.

  ## Usage
  See test section for examples of how to use. The main thing to know is that you will need to create a database in mysql using the provided schema. After that you will need to make sure to either seed the database yourself, or use a sample provided in the repo as well. You can do so by using the command line and typing npm run seed. In order to actually play around with the APIs though, you will need to run your tests through Insomnia Core.
